# Final Year Project - Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning 

This project utilizes deep learning models to detect brain tumors from medical imaging data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization to build a reliable and interpretable solution for brain tumor detection.

## ðŸŒŸ Features 
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
  - Handling class imbalances for robust training.
- **Deep Learning Models**:
  - Implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
  - Training, validation, and testing with detailed performance metrics.
- **Visualization**:
  - Graphs for training/validation accuracy and loss.
  - Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize model predictions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance assessment.
